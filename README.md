`api/characters?sort_by_name=value`

-   For ascending order the acceptable value is `asc`

# DATABASE DESIGN

## Models

The database is made up of 4 models:

-   Books
-   Characters
-   Comments
-   BooksCharacters

### 1. Book

This table holds the basic details that describe a book. It has the following fields:

-   **id** - an integer value that is unique to each book
-   **name** - a string value for the title of the book
-   **authors** - a JSON field for storing a list of authors for the book
-   **released** - A DateTime value that shows when the book was published
-   **created_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was created
-   **updated_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was last updated

### 2. Character

All characters in the series of books are stored in this model. Each character has only one record in this model.
The model has the following fields:

-   **id** - an integer value that is unique to each character
-   **name** - a string value for the name of each character
-   **gender** - a string value for the gender of the character
-   **date_of_birth** - a DateTime value that shows when the character was born
-   **created_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was created
-   **updated_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was last updated

### 3. Comment

Holds all the comments made for all books. There is a one-to-many relationship between the Book model and the Comment model. i.e one book can have many comments but a comment can only belong to one book
The model has the following fields:

-   **id** - an autoincrement integer value that is unique to each comment
-   **book_id** - a foreign key to the book model that shows the book that the comment belongs to
-   **ip_address** - a string value that shows the IP address of the anonymous user that made the comment
-   **created_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was created
-   **updated_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was last updated

### 4. BooksCharacters

This table links each character to each book they appear. There is a many-to-many relationship between the Book model and the Character model.
The model has the following fields:

-   **book_id** - a foreign key to a book that a character appears in
-   **character_id** - a foreign key to a character that has appeared in the respective book pointed to by book_id
-   **created_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was created
-   **updated_at** - a UTC DateTime value that shows when the record was last updated
